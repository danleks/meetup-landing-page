# meetup-landing-page
‘Meetup’ is a landing page devoted to promoting an event. Sections include intro overview, speakers, multi-price ticket options, event schedule (with day switcher), a contact form and a Twitter feed. You can integrate those Buy buttons into something like PayPal, Gumroad or Shopify.

This is a free template I recreated for learning purposes.
The website is created with Gatsby and Sass.
